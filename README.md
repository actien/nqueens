A solution to the n-queens problem.
There is a much, much more elegant solution on Wikipedia, but doing it recursively helped me to refresh on recursive programming, which, while memory intensive, is always interesting for me to think about and solve. 

I often fall into the trap of trying to recurse in my head, instead of looking at base cases and what should happen in each instance.
